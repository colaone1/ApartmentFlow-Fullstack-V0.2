# TODO / Next Session

## 1. Private Listings Visibility

- Add a toggle or filter on the listings page (or a dedicated 'My Listings' page) to show private listings created by the logged-in user.
- Ensure the backend API supports fetching a user's private listings.

## 2. Commute Feature on Listing Details

- Add a commute input section to the apartment details page to allow users to enter an address and see the distance/time from the listing's location.
- Use the backend or Google Maps API to calculate and display the commute distance/time.

## 3. Notes Feature (Retest & Polish)

- Test adding, editing, deleting, and filtering notes on listings.
- Fix any issues found during testing.
